## 🧠 Project Overview

**Gistify** is a user-friendly web application built with **Streamlit** that allows you to quickly generate concise summaries of long texts. It leverages a powerful pre-trained deep learning model from the **Hugging Face Transformers** library to extract the most important information from your input, providing you with a *gist* of the content.
